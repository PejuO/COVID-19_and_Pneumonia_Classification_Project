COVID-19 and Pneumonia Classification with Deep Learning Project¶
The purpose of this project is develop a learning model that supports doctors with diagnosing illnesses that affect patients’ lungs. 
This project uses X-ray lung scans with examples of patients who had either pneumonia, Covid-19, or no illness. The data was downloaded 
from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/pranavraikokte/covid19-image-dataset). Keras was used to create a classification model that outputs 
a diagnosis based on the patient's X-ray scan.
